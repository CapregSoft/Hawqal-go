# Collaborator Guide

Welcome to the Hawqal collaborator guide! This document outlines the process for collaborating on Hawqal and provides some guidelines for working with other contributors.

## Communication

We use GitHub issues and pull requests to communicate about specific issues and changes to the codebase. For general discussion, we use Slack. If you're not already a member of the Hawqal Slack workspace, please contact one of the project maintainers or collaborators to be added.

## Branching and Merging

When working on a new feature or bug fix, please create a new branch and make your changes there. When you're ready to merge your code into the main branch, please submit a pull request and ask for a review from one of the project maintainers.

## Code Review

All code changes go through a code review process before they are merged into the main branch. One of the project maintainers will review your code and provide feedback. Please make sure to address any feedback before merging your code.

## Testing

Before merging your code into the main branch, please make sure to thoroughly test your changes. If you've added any new features, please include test cases to ensure that the new code is working as expected.

## Documentation

We place a high importance on documentation. If you've added a new feature or made significant changes to the codebase, please make sure to update the documentation to reflect these changes.

If you have any questions about collaborating on Hawqal, please don't hesitate to ask!
